    <h2>Per Command</h2>
    <div>
        <p>To use Crate.io on a per command basis you can use pip's -i option to tell it to use <a href="http://simple.crate.io/">http://simple.crate.io/</a> as it's index.</p>
        <p>For Example if you wanted to install lxml from Crate.io you would simple type <code>pip install -i http://simple.crate.io/ lxml</code></p>
    </div>

    <h2>Per Requirements File</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Pip also allows you to setup a custom index per requirements file, doing this is just as simple as per command, but it saves you from having to type it out each time.</p>
        <p>To enable Crate.io for a particular requirements file, just edit the file and add <code>-i http://simple.crate.io/</code> as the first line of the file. Save it and then run <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></p>
    </div>

    <h2>Globally</h2>
    <div>
        <p>You've tried it out per command, set up some of your requirements files to use it, now you're ready to go all out and Globally switch to Crate.io</p>
        <p>Luckily Pip makes this easy for us again and you can set up your global index url in pip.conf.</p>
        <p>If you are on Unix or OSX your pip.conf is located at <code>$HOME/.pip/pip.conf</code> while on windows it's located at <code>%HOME%\pip\pip.ini</code></p>
        <p>Once you have your pip.conf file open and ready to edit, just add (or edit!) your file so it includes a section like
<pre class="offset3 span6">
    [global]
    index-url = http://simple.crate.io/
</pre></p>
    </div>
